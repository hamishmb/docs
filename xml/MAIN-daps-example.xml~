                    DDRescue-GUI is a Graphical User Interface for GNU ddrescue, a data recovery tool. GNU ddrescue is a command-line (text-only) program, so using this interface with it brings you all of the power ddrescue has to offer, combined with the ease of use of a simple, cross-platform GUI. This document will teach you how to use both GNU ddrescue and DDRescue-GUI, and serves as a general-purpose troubleshooting reference.

        <simplesect xml:id="WhyReadThisDoc">
            <title>Why read this document?</title>
            <para>
            Well, for a lot of reasons. Firstly, data recovery is a complex and delicate subject, and even when using tools as powerful as GNU ddrescue, things can go wrong, especially if you're not experienced. That might sound quite negative, but in truth it's exactly why I wrote DDRescue-GUI; I've made a fair few mistakes when doing data recovery. Some of them have simply wasted a bit of time, but some of them have meant I've lost data. I'm simply fortunate that the data I lost wasn't important, but if a GUI like this had existed when I first used ddrescue, and wasn't used to using the command-line, I could have avoided making some of those mistakes. I wrote this book so you can avoid making some of the mistakes I've made.
            </para>

            <para>
            The other reason is that while (and, perhaps, because) GNU ddrescue is extraordinarily powerful, it can be quite confusing to use. It has a lot of options, some of which are generally useful, and some of which apply more to corner-cases, so I hope this document will be helpful when you're deciding which options to use. When writing the GUI, I've tried to help you make the best decisions by using reasonable defaults, but here I will explain the options properly, which should help with some of the confusion some of my users have experienced.

            <title>What is covered in this document?</title>
            <para>
            Hopefully, it covers anything you might want to know about DDRescue-GUI, ddrescue, and data recovery in general. I know that's a large undertaking for a small book, so at various points I may direct you to read other materials for more detail in particular areas.

	                DDRescue-GUI is an open source GUI frontend for GNU ddrescue. It is designed to make ddrescue easier to use, as it is a command-line application. DDRescue-GUI brings ddrescue to a wider audience than was previously possible because "normal" users can use it. This chapter provides basic information about ddrescue and DDRescue-GUI.
