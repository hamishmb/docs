                    DDRescue-GUI is a Graphical User Interface for GNU ddrescue, a data recovery tool. GNU ddrescue is a command-line (text-only) program, so using this interface with it brings you all of the power ddrescue has to offer, combined with the ease of use of a simple, cross-platform GUI. This document will teach you how to use both GNU ddrescue and DDRescue-GUI, and serves as a general-purpose troubleshooting reference.

            <title>Why read this document?</title>
            <para>
            Well, for a lot of reasons. Firstly, data recovery is a complex and delicate subject, and even when using tools as powerful as GNU ddrescue, things can go wrong, especially if you're not experienced. That might sound quite negative, but in truth it's exactly why I wrote DDRescue-GUI; I've made a fair few mistakes when doing data recovery. Some of them have simply wasted a bit of time, but some of them have meant I've lost data. I'm simply fortunate that the data I lost wasn't important, but if a GUI like this had existed when I first used ddrescue, and wasn't used to using the command-line, I could have avoided making some of those mistakes. I wrote this book so you can avoid making some of the mistakes I've made.
            </para>

            <para>
            The other reason is that while (and, perhaps, because) GNU ddrescue is extraordinarily powerful, it can be quite confusing to use. It has a lot of options, some of which are generally useful, and some of which apply more to corner-cases, so I hope this document will be helpful when you're deciding which options to use. When writing the GUI, I've tried to help you make the best decisions by using reasonable defaults, but here I will explain the options properly, which should help with some of the confusion some of my users have experienced.

        <title>What is DDRescue-GUI?</title>

            <abstract>
                <para>
	                DDRescue-GUI is an open source GUI frontend for GNU ddrescue. It is designed to make ddrescue easier to use, as it is a command-line application. DDRescue-GUI brings ddrescue to a wider audience than was previously possible because "normal" users can use it. This chapter provides basic information about ddrescue and DDRescue-GUI. I'm going to start at the start, to make sure everything is very clear. If you already know about ddrescue and DDRescue-GUI, you can probably skip to the next chapter.

        <section>
            <title>What is GNU ddrescue?</title> <!--TODO Screenshot of ddrescue in action-->
            <para>
                GNU ddrescue is a data recovery program, written by Antonio Diaz Diaz. It's amazingly powerful, and has a lot of features other tools don't have, such as the ability to use a log file, which means that if your system crashes during a recovery, you can start again where you left off.
            </para>
            <para>
                Other features include multiple passes over drives to try and get the easy-to-read data first, direct disk access (complicated so I will explain it later), and disk-to-disk recovery. It was originally written for Linux, ddrescue can actually run just fine on macOS and even Windows, which makes it all the more impressive. 
            </para>
            <para>
                That's where the difficulty comes in, though. Firstly, ddrescue is a commandline tool, which means only people who are used to using the text-only commandline are going to be able to use it. It's possible to figure it out anyway, but if you're not confident that you're doing it right you could cause loss of data. Despite this, ddrescue is probably still the best data recovery tool out there.
            </para>
            <para>
                The second problem is that while ddrescue will run on macOS and Windows, you have to compile it, which is often slow, difficult, and confusing, especially if you aren't used to doing this sort of thing. All of that is probably enough to turn some people away from using ddrescue, sadly. DDRescue-GUI provides a graphical interface for ddrescue, and solves some of these other problems as well.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>What is DDRescue-GUI?</title> <!--TODO Screenshot of DDRescue-GUI in action-->
            <para>
                DDRescue-GUI aims to bring GNU ddrescue to a wider audience by providing a graphical interface. DDRescue-GUI is cross platform, running on macOS and Linux. On macOS, DDRescue-GUI comes with a precompiled copy of ddrescue, so you can just install it and get to work. The GUI also provides other features not present in ddrescue, such as disk information, to help make sure you select the right disks for your recovery, auto-unmounting of devices (I will explain this later), and useful tips and suggestions to help you get set up.
            </para>
            <para>
                DDRescue-GUI lets you use most of ddrescue's features, as well as guiding you. On macOS, some of these features aren't available if you're just using ddrescue by itself, but in a few cases DDRescue-GUI can work around the problem and provide a way for you to use them.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Why should I use DDRescue-GUI?</title>
            <para>
                If the features above didn't convince you, then this might :) If you're a normal user and wondering why you should use this program with ddrescue instead of one of the other popular tools, you should know that ddrescue is smarter than quite a lot of the other tools:
            </para>
            <para>
                Let's imagine that you have an old hard drive with precious data on it, say, family photos. GNU ddrescue will try to read the easiy-readable parts of the disk first, which might grab, say, 70% of your photos quickly. This is important because drives often fail quite soon after showing warning signs, and it might let you get a fair amount of data before your drive completely gives up. After this, ddrescue will make several more passes to try and get the rest of the data.
            </para>
            <para>
                Some other tools, such as SpinRite, tend to read the drive in sequence, and refuse to give up when they find an unreadable part of the drive. Combined with other things, this can theoretically get the data off your drive and even fix your drive. However, it could also break your drive before you get much data, especially if there are a load of bad areas at the start of the drive, but most of the rest of it is readable. Note that SpinRite is a well-respected tool, and has helped a lot of people, so I mean no disrespect to its users or authors. I would worry about using a disk again after it failed though, even if it had been fixed.
            </para>
            <para>
                That aside, if you're an adminisrator, you might enjoy looking at ddrescue's output so you can see exactly what going on, rather than use a styled GUI. I certainly do. In this case, you're in luck: DDRescue-GUI makes it easy for you to see the output as well, if you want to. <!-- Screenshot -->

                <para>
	                In order to be able to use any data recovery tools, you need to understand some of the concepts behind data recovery. This chapter will explain the basics, and it will also show you how to get help when you're using the GUI. You can safely skip this chapter if you already understand the concepts, because I've gone into fairly basic detail here.

        <section>
            <title>Device Names</title>
            <para>
                Device names are a bit of a weird concept to a lot of people, particularly those who use Windows, where drive letters are used instead, like C:, D: and so on. On Linux and macOS, however, devices (like hard drives, USB drives, DVD drives) have names. These names are used to access the drives, so for example, to read directly from the DVD drive, you might read from a device called "/dev/sr0" (Linux), or "/dev/disk1" (macOS), which you can think of as being similar to the D: drive in Windows.
            </para>
            <para>
                Linux and macOS tend to use different names for devices. On Linux, it's quite common to have names like "/dev/sda" (first hard drive), "/dev/sdb" (second hard drive), and "/dev/sr0" (first optical drive). You might also see names like "/dev/sda1", which represents the first partition on the first hard drive. macOS, however, tends to call disks "/dev/disk0" (first disk in the system, usually the boot drive), "/dev/disk1" (could be a hard drive, USB drive, or optical drive), and "/dev/disk1s2" (second partition on the second drive). It's a bit easier to understand the Linux names. If you're finding this confusing, don't worry, because I will explain it more clearly along with some of the other concepts. It's quite complicated.
            </para>
            <para>
                Now for the really confusing bit. While you CAN read directly from these devices, you won't be able to understand what you're reading. This is where it becomes different from Windows. On Linux and macOS, pretty much everything is accessed as a file, including devices. So, essentially, when you read from, say, "/dev/disk0", you're actually reading data directly from the hard drive as if it were a file. In order to be able to use the drive in any meaningful way, it need to have partitions.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Partitions and File Systems</title>
            <para>
                Okay. Device names can be a bit confusing, but it'll start to make more sense soon. A partition is, literally, just a section of a hard drive or other device. Usually, you only need partitions on hard drives, and other devices like DVDs often don't have them at all. You can have many partitions on one drive, often up to 4, but sometimes more than that.
            </para>
            <para>
                Right, so we have devices and partitions, but to actually store data, the partitions need a file system. This organises the files and keeps track of where they are and how large they are. A file system is what you see in Windows as, say, C:, or E:. Remember that some devices like DVDs don't need partitions, and the device has the filesystem itself.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>"Mounting" and "Unmounting" Devices</title>
            <para>
                You might have heard these terms before if you use Linux or macOS. If you have a partition with a file system, you need to "mount" it to make it usable. You could think of it like opening a book, I guess: All the information is there in the book, but you need to open it before you can read it. In Windows, mounted device get drive letters like C:. In Linux and macOS, mounted devices are given a folder where they can be accessed, like "/media/data", for example. When you;re finished with a drive, you should unmount it, which i usually done when you shut down your computer.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Bad Sectors</title>
            <para>
                A sector is a very small area of a disk. The exact size can very, but never the less, it's very small. When a sector becomes unreadable, it is called a bad sector. Bad sectors can happen because of corrosion, scratches, shock damage and so on.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Data Corruption</title>
            <para>
                This often happens because of bad sectors, but can also be due to power loss while writing data and many other things. Basically, it's data that can be read, but it isn't completely intact so it might not be readable. If you're unlucky, this might happen to you after doing a recovery with ddrescue and/or DDRescue-GUI. In that case, you'll need to use some more tools to fix it so you can read your files.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>"Disks"</title>
            <para>
                This is quite a vague term that can mean a lot of things. In this user guide, and in the program, a disk is a partition or device that contains a file system.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Formatting</title>
            <para>
                If you format a disk, you are giving it a file system. This can also mean erasing the previous filesystem and everything it contains. If you say a disk has is formatted as FAT32, it means the disk has a FAT32 filesystem on it. Often when a disk is formatted, the data on it isn't actually overwritten, and it can sometimes be recovered. The same goes for deletion.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Deleting and Undeleting</title>
            <para>
                You almost certainly know what deleting is. What you might not know, though, is that when you delete a file it isn't actually "gone" most of the time. Often, the reference that tells your computer the file exists is deleted, and the space the file was using is marked as free, but the actual file is still there, until it gets overwritten by something else later.
            </para>

            <para>
                Because the files aren't often overwritten until later, if a file was deleted recently, it can often be "undeleted". This is where a special program reads through all the empty space on your disk and looks for file fragments that haven't been overwritten yet. You can often recover a surprising amount of data by doing this.
            </para>

            <para>
                NOTE: GNU ddrescue and DDRescue-GUI aren't undelete tools, but you can often use them with undelete tools to get more data back.
            </para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Image Files</title>
            <para>
                These hold a filesystem, much like a partition. This is a weird concept, but if you think about it, if everything in macOS and Linux is represented as a file, including partitions, it makes sense that a file can hold all the data from a partition or device. Image files are usually created by literally copying the file that represents a partition or a disk. Image files can have partitions inside too, just like a hard drive.
            </para>

            <para>
                You might be wondering why these are helpful. Often they're used for backups, but also for data recovery. You can recovery data from a bad DVD, say, and save the data into a file. This is good, because often after doing a recovery, some of the data you got is corrupted, and it needs to be analysed with another tool. It's much easier to do this if you recover to a file.
            </para>

        </section>

        <section>
            <title>The Disk Info Window</title> <!-- Screenshot -->
            <para>
                A lot of these terms are confusing to people who haven't heard them before. To make it easier to use the GUI, I have included a disk information window. This windows shows you device names, but also other information about disks such as size, label, the model, and the description. All of that will help you figure out what device names you want to use, and help prevent data loss.

	                This chapter covers the basic functionality you'll need to use in DDRescue-GUI. It's supposed to be just enough for you to get started using DDRescue-GUI.

            <para>
                That was quite a lot of introduction material there. Now we'll get started with using the GUI. Firstly, here's the main window:

                <!-- Screenshot -->

                <caution>
                    <para>
                        If you're using a version of ddrescue I don't support, you'll get a warning at this point. If you see the warning, check you're running the latest version of DDRescue-GUI.
                    </para>
                </caution>

                This window is displayed after DDRescue-GUI has finished starting up. There are 3 main things you need to set here. The "Image Source" is the damaged drive. The log file is optional, and used to resume where you left off if you don't want to recover all the data at once.

                <tip>
                    <para>
                        It's highly recommended that you use a log file. It only takes a few seconds to do, and it means that you can stop and start the recovery as you please. It also allows you to resume your recovery if, say, there's  power outage, or your computer crashes. If that happened and you didn't use a log file you would probably have to start from the start!
                    </para>
                </tip>

                Finally, you have the "Image Destination", which is where you want to recover your data to. This can be another device, or an image file.

                GNU Free Documentation License
                 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008


 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.]]>
