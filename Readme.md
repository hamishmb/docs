The repository contains documentation for all of my programs.
You can find html, pdf, and epub documentation for the programs on my website at www.hamishmb.altervista.org.

For build instructions, see below.

-------------------- Prerequisites to build --------------------

You need DAPS (the Docbook Authoring and Publishing Suite) and all its dependencies. For source and installation instructions, see https://github.com/openSUSE/daps.

Currently, this documentation is available:

-------------------- DDRescue-GUI Documentation --------------------

Clone this repository and run (without the quotes):

"dapd -d DC-daps-ddrescue-gui <format>"

where <format> is one of "html", "html --single", "pdf", "epub".

You're welcome to try other formats if you like, but I don't know whether they'll work.
